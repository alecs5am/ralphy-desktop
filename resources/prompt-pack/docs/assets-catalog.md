# Assets catalog

Manifest version: `2` · Updated: `2026-05-13T13:18:01.564Z`

## How the layers fit together

- **`required`** — template-bound mandatory assets. Auto-pulled when you run `ralphy template use <slug>`. Listed here for transparency; you rarely pull these directly.
- **`pool`** — generic, reusable assets grouped by **kind** (open-ended: gameplay-loops, italian-brainrot-characters, trend-music, stock-broll, and future additions). Pull individual items on demand with `ralphy assets pull-pool <kind>/<slug>`. The agent should consult this catalog before generating prompts that reference real-world IP / characters / footage.
- **`examples`** — ready-made example mp4 outputs per template, for visual reference / regression baselines.

### `trend-music` (27)

Recognizable horror / dread music beds heavily used on horror-TikTok in 2024-2026. Sourced from the canonical 'Horror TikTok' YouTube playlist (PLan_O7sHy-ObDv02Jn67zodPb1MrdoIvo). Each item ships the full mp3 plus a pre-rendered 20-second hook clip (the loudest middle-of-track region with fade-in/out) under `hooks/`. The agent should pick a track whose `mood` and `tags` match the scenario, then either drop the hook clip directly (TikTok-style) or use the full mp3 and trim in the composition.
